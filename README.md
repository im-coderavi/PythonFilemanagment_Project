# 📁 Advanced File Management System (Python)  

A **menu-driven File Management System** built using Python that allows users to manage files easily using **numeric options only**.  
This project focuses on **clean code**, **real-world logic**, and **beginner-friendly understanding**, while still being **interview-ready**.

## 📸 How It Works

1. Program starts with a **menu-driven interface**
2. User selects options using **numbers only**

4. Safety checks are applied (file existence, delete confirmation, etc.)
5. Program runs continuously until the user chooses **Exit**
